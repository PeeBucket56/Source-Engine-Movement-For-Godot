i heavily modified code from another github repository but i forgot the name. if i find it again, i will link it here. 

I changed some of the values to make it more similar to the source engine, and i also added crouching. This project includes bunnyhopping, strafing, and more.

INSTRUCTIONS --
  1-unzip the ZIP file
  2-open the "project.godot" in in the godot engine.
  3-there is already a testing world in the project so you can modify that however you like
  4-modify (or keep it how it is) and have fun!

Do what you want with it! i dont care, i dont want credit. use it for whatever you want!!
